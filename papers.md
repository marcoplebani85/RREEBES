TREE xx 1-10](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534715000774) TMM: Would be interesting to reproduce this study to get an idea about the removed interactions (the forbidden ones) - and the ones that are still in, but false. Maybe one could also apply this to a smaller food web and test for the accuracy of this approach. Because the authors do not provide any test for accuracy... :(
